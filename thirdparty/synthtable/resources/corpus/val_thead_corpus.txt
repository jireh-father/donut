- A lot of people don't take it as seriously as others. I know people who haven't prepared, who don't realise how much effort other people put into it. If they did realise it, they would obviously prepare more.
- I did that constantly through the entire interview process, thinking: "What would they want me to say?"
- If I know that she's using her Nepal story whenever she gets the chance, then I've gotta exaggerate and slide in my stories as much as I can.
- None
- Specific knowledge without research activity
- That's not what they want to hear--even if you had good justification, you're not going to take the risk of saying it.
- There's like the truth, and then people tend to embellish--you'll bring certain things to the forefront that, maybe you didn't spend as much time doing, but that's like your only volunteer thing, so you're going to really like bring up, so you're not necessarily lying.
- Unspecific knowledge
- Use of QOL assessment for research purpose
- Use of QOL assessment in clinical practice
- You know what they want from that question--volunteerism is a good thing. No-one is going to say volunteerism is a bad thing.

Social inequalities in health■ Caste and socioeconomic inequalities in women’s health were observed: 1) women from lower castes reported a higher prevalence of poor health than women from high castes; 2) socioeconomic inequalities in health existed regardless of the indicator used (education, women’s employment status, or household landholdings; and 3) multilevel models indicated that among women with low caste affiliations, the influence of socioeconomic indicators led to a “magnifying” effect, whereas among women with high caste affiliations, a “buffering” effect was found [15].

Volunteer
Volunteerism was the topic, but my approach was: this is a chance to sell myself. Bottom line: I didn't really think of it as an essay--it was more like "How can I adapt why I would be a good candidate into this essay and mould it into the topic that they gave me?" You sell yourself and want them to want you.

• Achieved some monitoring of population levels of physical activity through national surveys.
• Attempted to integrate physical activity policy with other national policy agendas;
• Incorporated multiple strategies (particularly multiple individual-oriented components and to a lesser extent, environmentally-focused interventions);
• Patient-related factors:• Age: young/middle-aged adults > infants/elderly• Gender: Women > men• Genetic polymorphisms• Viral infections: HIV, herpes viruses• Previous reaction to the drug
• Undertook broad consultation with key stakeholders from different sectors;
• Worked (or planned to work) at multiple levels (e.g., national, state, local) to coordinate and implement their policies; and
